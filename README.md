# tga-verify

Script to verify Wii U meta images for use in custom channels

## Notes

This is originally based on [Zarklord's TgaVerify](https://gbatemp.net/threads/450997), most of the logic and code is from that.

This isn't as needed anymore, as homebrew is distributed through WUHBs for use with Aroma, though I still wanted to rewrite the original.
